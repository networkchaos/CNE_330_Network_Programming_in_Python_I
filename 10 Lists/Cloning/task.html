<p>Write a function, <strong><code>create_clone</code></strong>,
    that returns a clone of the list provided</p>

<p>If we want to modify a list and also keep a copy of the original,
    we need to be able to make a copy of the list itself, not just the reference.
    This process is sometimes called cloning, to avoid the ambiguity of the word copy. </p>
<p>The easiest way to clone a list is to use the slice operator.</p>
